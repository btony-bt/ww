      <h2>Why MindBridge Stands Out</h2>
      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Expert Mentorship</h3>
          <p>Every course is taught by industry professionals with 5+ years of experience. Our mentors aren't just teachers—they're active practitioners solving problems daily in their fields. You learn from people doing the actual work.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Outcome-Focused Learning</h3>
          <p>We measure success by your career outcomes, not just course completion. Our programs are designed with hiring managers, and 92% of graduates secure relevant roles within 6 months of completion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Interactive Live Sessions</h3>
          <p>Weekly live classes with real-time doubt-solving, breakout room discussions, and peer collaboration. Every session is recorded, but the magic happens when you learn together with your cohort.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Career-Ready Projects</h3>
          <p>Build a portfolio of real-world projects that employers care about. Your capstone project becomes your calling card—many of our graduates land jobs directly through their project showcase.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Affordable & Flexible</h3>
          <p>Learn at your own pace with lifetime access to course materials. We offer need-based scholarships, EMI options, and flexible start dates because we believe cost shouldn't hold you back.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Global Community</h3>
          <p>Connect with 48,000+ learners across 85 countries. Collaborate on projects, find accountability partners, attend exclusive alumni events, and expand your professional network globally.</p>

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>MindBridge was born from a simple observation: talented individuals around the world were struggling to access quality education and find mentors who could guide their careers. In 2019, our founder Arun Kapoor noticed brilliant developers, designers, and entrepreneurs in tier-2 and tier-3 cities competing for the same opportunities as those in major tech hubs—but with a fraction of the resources and guidance.</p>
      <p>What started as a single course on web development with 23 students has grown into a thriving ecosystem of 48,000+ learners and 320+ expert mentors. Today, MindBridge graduates are building startups, leading teams at Fortune 500 companies, and mentoring the next generation of learners. Our mission remains unchanged: bridge the gap between potential and opportunity.</p>
